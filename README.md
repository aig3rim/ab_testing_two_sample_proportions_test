# ab_testing_two_sample_proportions_test

## Introduction
This repository is for a Medium blog post "A/B testing with binary data: Two sample proportions test for a marketing campaign". The notebook shows how to apply hyphothesis testing to understand whether a campaign was statitically significant or not for a situation, when the input is binary data.

## Motivation
As a data scientist, I find that hyphothesis testing is an important tool for data-driven decision making. So I decided to deepen my knowledge in the field and run some experiments using publically available data... (rewrite)

## Getting started
To run the notebook you need the following packages:
* pandas
* numpy
* math
* statsmodels
* scipy
* matplotlib

## Dataset 
I am using a dataset of a marketing campaign from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/faviovaz/marketing-ab-testing).
The idea of the dataset is to analyze the groups, find if the ads were successful, how much the company can make from the ads, and if the difference between the groups is statistically significant.
